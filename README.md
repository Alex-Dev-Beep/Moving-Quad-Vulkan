# A moving quad made in Vulkan with C++. For learning purposes, still in development.
## For windows, it uses WIN_API, and it's destinated to use own APIs for each OS.
### Why? SDL and GFLW libraries abstract a lot, and are not low level. Using WIN_API gives less input lag, just like it's better than using external libraries.
### It uses the vulkan graphics API because it's the most performant currently, just like low-level.
